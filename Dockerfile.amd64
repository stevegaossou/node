# Starting with iptables v1.8.2 the binary package includes iptables-nft and
# iptables-legacy, two variants of the iptables command line interface. The
# nftables-based is the default in Debian Buster and works with the nf_tables
# Linux kernel subsystem. The legacy one uses the x_tables Linux kernel
# subsystem. Users can use the update-alternatives system to select one variant
# or the other.
# Force iptables and ip6tables to use legacy and output their status afterwards
